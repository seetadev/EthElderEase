How ElderEase Uses Amazon Bedrock

1. Bedrock-Powered AI Assistance for Seniors
- ElderEase uses Amazon Bedrock’s LLMs and Knowledge Bases to provide:
- Personalized concierge services – AI agents tailor recommendations for seniors’ daily tasks, appointments, and home maintenance needs.
- Natural language understanding via Alexa Skills – Seniors can request cleaning, home repairs, or assistance with daily tasks through voice commands, making technology accessible for all.
- Automated smart home control – Bedrock Agents trigger actions like turning off appliances, setting reminders, or managing IoT home security systems.

2. Knowledge Base Management & Custom AI Models
- Creating a domain-specific Knowledge Base on Amazon S3, storing verified home maintenance and elderly care workflows.
- Bedrock Agents retrieve contextual information to provide task-specific guidance and service execution.
- Integration with Bedrock RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ensures that real-time data enhances AI responses, making ElderEase adaptive and insightful.

3. Hosting & Compute Infrastructure on AWS
- EC2 Instances for AI Compute & Web Apps
- Hosting Home Cleaning & Concierge Services apps on EC2 for real-time AI-driven assistance.
- Running custom AI models on Bedrock, deployed on EC2-backed microservices.
- Serverless execution with Lambda for event-driven workflows, ensuring efficient task automation with Web3 triggers.

4. Secure Web3 Payments with Agentic Ethereum
