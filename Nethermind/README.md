# Nethermind Track

This directory contains code and documentation for the Nethermind track of the ElderEase project. We are participating in both Track 1 and Track 3.

ElderEase is an AI-driven home maintenance, concierge, and road assistance platform designed for elderly care. It integrates:
- Nethermind‚Äôs dotnet-libp2p for decentralized AI agent communication.
- Agentic Ethereum for secure payments and task automation.
- Turtle Blocks for AI-driven home robotics.
- Roadside Assistance using FFmpeg-powered live video streaming with ONVIF, HTTP, RTSP cameras and YOLO-based AI object detection.

This platform ensures seamless peer-to-peer AI coordination, smart contract-based service automation, and secure Web3-powered elder care & mobility assistance.

How ElderEase Aligns with Nethermind‚Äôs AI + Blockchain Bounty

1. Roadside Assistance: AI Video Analytics & Ethereum Integration
- FFmpeg & ONVIF cameras decode & stream live road footage to detect obstacles, accidents, or roadside issues in real-time.
- Tiny YOLO deep learning models detect predefined object classes like vehicles, pedestrians, road hazards and trigger alarms.
- Users manually confirm alerts, which are:
- Saved to IPFS for immutable storage.
- Logged on Ethereum Testnet via a lookup smart contract using iOS UUIDs as keys.
- Ethereum smart contracts automate payments for emergency services via L2 transactions.

dotnet-libp2p enables secure peer-to-peer communication between AI agents, roadside assistance providers, and emergency responders.

2. AI Governance: Multi-Agent System with dotnet-libp2p
- AI agents prioritize emergency assistance based on detected hazards and vote on best response strategies.
- Ethereum smart contracts encode these decisions, allowing transparent, decentralized governance of elderly assistance tasks.
- dotnet-libp2p TCP connections facilitate real-time, decentralized coordination between AI agents, home assistants, and roadside responders.

3. AI-Powered Home & Concierge Services with Ethereum
- Turtle Blocks enables robotic automation for home tasks (cleaning, medication reminders, safety monitoring).
- Users fund home & road services via Ethereum L2, and AI agents trigger on-chain service requests.
- Alexa Skill integration allows elderly users to voice-command AI agents for help.

Qualification Criteria
- Technical Depth ‚Äì Uses Nethermind‚Äôs dotnet-libp2p, FFmpeg, ONVIF, YOLO AI models, Ethereum smart contracts, and IPFS storage.
- Novelty ‚Äì First-of-its-kind peer-to-peer AI + Ethereum integration for elderly home & mobility assistance.

### Track 3: Dotnet libp2p issues: https://github.com/NethermindEth/dotnet-libp2p/issues/119 and https://github.com/seetadev/dotnet-libp2p

Adding a .NET app to the Universal Connectivity app set would significantly enhance libp2p‚Äôs cross-platform reach, making it more accessible to C# developers, enterprise applications, and Windows-based systems. Here‚Äôs why this is a valuable addition and how it aligns well with libp2p‚Äôs goals:

1. Expanding Libp2p's Reach to .NET Developers
- The .NET ecosystem is widely used in enterprise solutions, game development (Unity), and cloud applications.
- Supporting TCP and optional QUIC in a .NET libp2p implementation ensures compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it easier for developers to integrate libp2p into diverse applications.
- It aligns with the recent momentum in dotnet-libp2p (https://github.com/NethermindEth/dotnet-libp2p), ensuring ongoing improvements to the ecosystem.

3. Robust Networking with TCP & QUIC
- TCP support ensures compatibility with existing network infrastructure and legacy applications.
- Optional QUIC support provides low-latency, connection migration, and improved NAT traversal, crucial for P2P and mobile-first applications.
- This flexibility makes the solution ideal for distributed systems, Web3 applications, and high-performance gaming/networking tools.

4. Usability with a Console UI
- A console UI makes it easy to test and interact with the app, improving developer experience and debugging capabilities.
- A well-designed CLI can serve as a testing ground for future GUI-based implementations, like a .NET-based dashboard for managing peer connections.
- This would be especially useful for devs working in Windows environments, where CLI-based workflows improve automation and integration.

5. Contribution to Universal Connectivity
- By integrating with the Universal Connectivity app set, the .NET app ensures interoperability with other libp2p implementations across Go, Rust, JS, and Python.
- It promotes cross-platform communication, ensuring that Windows, cloud-native, and enterprise applications can seamlessly connect with libp2p networks.

6. Future Potential
- This could serve as a foundation for further .NET-based P2P projects, such as decentralized identity systems, peer-to-peer file sharing, and real-time messaging applications.
- A modular approach could allow for easy integration into .NET MAUI (cross-platform UI apps) or Unity-based P2P multiplayer systems.
Would love to see this move forward! üöÄ I‚Äôd be happy to discuss potential architecture choices, like using Nethermind‚Äôs dotnet-libp2p implementation or designing a lightweight .NET Core-based module. Are you planning to develop this from scratch, or will you be leveraging an existing libp2p library for .NET?
