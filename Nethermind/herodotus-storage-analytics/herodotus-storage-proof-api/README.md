# Herodotus’s Storage Proof API

We are using Herodotus’s Storage Proof API to enable patients to prove ownership of Medical Incident NFT they hold on Starknet using storage proofs. The Herodotus API is used to generate the needed storage proof and verify it on Starknet. 

Herodotus’s Storage Proof API a service aims at providing:
■Secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.
■Improving Data Transparency in Medication

Data Integrity and Responsible AIOps using Herodotus’s Storage Proof API: We are extending the implementation of Herodotus’s Storage Proof API to verify data integrity and prioritize the ranking of actions (pending, in progress and completed) at the government hospital to be undertaken on medical incidents depending upon the status (pending, in progress and completed). We are developing custom Web3 storage and data analytics solutions using Herodotus and tools to enable no code, low code analytics tooling using an open source analytics and visualization tool, namely, HerodotusXLS, which enables tabulation, organization, collaboration, visualization, graphing and charting.

## Why Storage Proofs?

Storage proofs are cryptographic proofs that demonstrate the integrity and availability of specific blockchain data. For example, a storage proof can be used to prove ownership of an ERC-721A NFT on the Goerli Blockchain in a specific block.

## Storage Proof API

This project leverages the Storage Proof API provided by Herodotus. The API enables developers to generate storage proofs for data on Ethereum Goerli and verify the correctness of this data on zkSync.

The API aims to make working with storage proofs as simple and easy as possible.
