# EigenLayerAVS Track

This directory contains code and documentation for the EigenLayerAVS track of the ElderEase project.

ElderEase leverages EigenLayer Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs) like Gaia and Hyperlane to enhance decentralized AI-powered home assistance, concierge services, and roadside support for the elderly. By integrating AVSs with Ethereum, we create a trust-minimized, verifiable, and scalable AI coordination network that ensures real-world safety and efficiency.

How ElderEase Uses EigenLayer AVSs

1. AI-Powered Home & Concierge Services with Gaia AVS
- Gaia AVS enables secure, verifiable execution of AI agents for home automation, concierge tasks, and elderly assistance:
- AI agents execute on Gaia AVS to ensure tamper-proof task delegation for elderly care.
- Decentralized verifiability ensures tasks like medication reminders, cleaning, and health monitoring are executed and logged transparently.
- Hyperlane (Interchain Messaging AVS) allows cross-chain execution of elder care smart contracts, enabling payments across multiple L2s.

2. Roadside Assistance Using AI + AVSs

Our roadside assistance system integrates Hyperlane AVS for cross-chain AI alerts and Gaia AVS for verifiable execution:
- FFmpeg-powered AI video analytics detects road hazards using Tiny YOLO & YOLOv2 models.
- Alarms are verifiably logged to Gaia AVS, ensuring authenticity and preventing tampering of critical safety alerts.
- EigenDA enables scalable and cost-efficient AI event storage, reducing gas costs for logging alerts on Ethereum L2.
- Users confirm alerts via their iOS device, and the alert hash is stored on Ethereum via Hyperlane AVS, making the event globally accessible to emergency responders.

3. EigenLayer Plugins for AI Agent Frameworks
We propose an AVS plugin for Eliza, allowing conversational AI agents to interface with Ethereum and Hyperlane AVS for executing on-chain elderly assistance tasks.
- AI agents deployed as AVSs can validate smart contract interactions for elder care payments, service requests, and verification of concierge tasks.


Final Vision: Verifiable AI Agents for Elderly Safety & Assistance

By using EigenLayer Autonomous Verifiable Services, ElderEase ensures trust-minimized, tamper-proof AI automation for elder care and roadside assistance, setting the foundation for verifiable, AI-driven Web3 services. üöÄüè°üöó
