# AgentKit Track

This directory contains code and documentation for the AgentKit track of the ElderEase project.

ElderEase is an AI-powered concierge, home maintenance, and cleaning service designed for elderly care users. It integrates AgentKit to enable seamless Web3 payments and on-chain interactions through Agentic Ethereum. By leveraging AgentKit, we empower AI agents to manage service requests, process transactions, and interact with decentralized protocolsâ€”abstracting away Web3 complexities for elderly users.

How We Are Using AgentKit

1. AI-Driven On-Chain Payments
- We utilize AgentKitâ€™s wallet integration to facilitate payments in FIL, ETH, and ERC-20 tokens for home maintenance, cleaning, and concierge services.
- AI agents autonomously execute transactions based on user requests, making payments gas-efficient and seamless.
- Smart contract interactions for service deposits and refunds ensure trustless payments.

2. Autonomous Web3 Agent Interactions
- ElderEaseâ€™s AI concierge uses AgentKit's on-chain action execution to interact with service providers, confirming bookings and triggering payments.
- The agent also verifies service completion using IPFS-stored records and sends proof to an Ethereum smart contract.
- Users interact with agents via Alexa Skills, voice commands, and mobile appsâ€”AgentKit ensures smooth on-chain execution.

3. Multi-Agent Collaboration with Agentic Ethereum
- Multi-agent systems coordinate home maintenance and emergency assistance, exchanging data via Nethermindâ€™s dotnet libp2p.
- When urgent maintenance or road assistance is required, an agent:
- Identifies the issue via TinyYOLO video analytics
- Stores alarm hash on Ethereum using iOS device UUID
- Triggers Web3 payment for emergency services via AgentKit

Why AgentKit?
- Seamless Web3 interactions: AI agents handle on-chain transactions natively without users needing to interact with wallets.
- Decentralized service orchestration: Autonomous agents manage service bookings, payments, and user verification on Ethereum.
- Improved accessibility: ElderEase makes crypto-based payments easy for seniors, leveraging voice commands and AI automation.
- Future-Proofing: AgentKitâ€™s framework scales with new Web3 protocols, allowing us to integrate EigenLayer AVSs, IPFS storage, and libp2p P2P networking.
