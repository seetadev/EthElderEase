# EthElderEase
ElderEase is an AI-powered concierge that leverages Amazon Bedrock, AgentKit, Nethermind, EigenLayer AVS, and libp2p to provide secure, decentralized home assistance and emergency monitoring for seniors.

🧩 Tech Stack & Architecture

1️⃣ AI-Powered Concierge & Automation (Amazon Bedrock + LLMs)
Amazon Bedrock Agents power ElderEase’s concierge, handling service requests, scheduling, and real-time decision-making.
Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Amazon Knowledge Bases to provide personalized responses based on elderly users' preferences, past interactions, and care needs.
Custom fine-tuned LLMs run on Bedrock, trained on elder care best practices, home maintenance data, and emergency protocols.
Hacky Trick:
 🔹 Dynamic AI workflows: Using Amazon Bedrock’s orchestration capabilities, we created "chain-of-thought" workflows, allowing AI agents to reason step-by-step before taking action.

2️⃣ Web3 Payments & Smart Contracts (AgentKit + Ethereum + Filecoin)
AgentKit enables seamless, gas-efficient payments for services via FIL, ETH, or stablecoins.
Smart contract escrow system ensures that payments are held until AI agents verify service completion.
Uses EigenLayer AVS (Hyperlane, Gaia) for trustless verification of completed tasks before releasing payments.
Hacky Trick:
 🔹 Voice-Activated Web3 Payments: We connected Alexa Skills to AgentKit, enabling seniors to pay service providers with "Alexa, confirm my home cleaning payment."

3️⃣ Secure & P2P AI Communication (Nethermind’s dotnet libp2p)
AI agents communicate directly using libp2p’s P2P networking stack instead of relying on centralized APIs.
Enables secure, low-latency service coordination between caregivers, cleaning staff, and maintenance teams.
Hacky Trick:
 🔹 No Centralized API Calls: Using Nethermind’s dotnet libp2p, AI agents send service requests, confirm payments, and exchange status updates without ever touching centralized cloud APIs.

4️⃣ AI-Powered Computer Vision & Emergency Alerts (FFmpeg + TinyYOLO + IPFS + Ethereum)
ElderEase’s home monitoring system uses cameras (ONVIF, RTSP, HTTP, iOS) with FFmpeg and TinyYOLO AI models to detect:
 ✅ Falls or accidents
 ✅ Intruders or unexpected movement
 ✅ Leaking pipes, fire hazards, or broken appliances
If a critical event is detected, AI agents generate an alert, which is:
Saved on IPFS
Hashed and stored on Ethereum using the iOS device UUID as the lookup key
Broadcasted via EigenLayer AVS (Witness Chain) for decentralized verification
Hacky Trick:
 🔹 No Cloud Storage Needed: Instead of relying on AWS or Google Cloud for event logs, ElderEase stores alarms directly on IPFS, ensuring privacy and censorship resistance.

5️⃣ EigenLayer AVS for On-Chain Verification (Hyperlane + Gaia + Opacity)
ElderEase integrates EigenLayer AVSs for decentralized verification of services and alarms:
 ✅ Hyperlane: Verifies service execution across chains
 ✅ Gaia: Ensures AI-generated alerts are verifiable and tamper-proof
 ✅ Opacity: Provides on-chain privacy for AI transactions
Hacky Trick:
 🔹 EigenLayer AVS as AI Validators: We use Gaia AVS to verify object detection results—ensuring that AI doesn’t falsely trigger alerts due to hallucinations.

6️⃣ Scalable AI Knowledge Base on AWS (S3 + Bedrock + EC2 Hosting)
AI concierge retrieves personalized recommendations from an S3-hosted knowledge base.
EC2 instances host AI-driven home cleaning services, scaling as demand grows.
Hacky Trick:
 🔹 Custom LLM Indexing: Instead of using a single vector DB, we precompute and cache embeddings for faster responses.

🚀 Key Innovations & Why It’s Exciting
✅ First AI concierge that combines Bedrock AI + AgentKit Web3 Payments + P2P Networking
 ✅ EigenLayer AVSs for verifiable, trustless service execution
 ✅ Decentralized, AI-driven emergency alerts stored on IPFS
 ✅ Privacy-first, Web3-powered elderly care that removes the need for centralized platforms
ElderEase isn’t just an AI concierge—it’s a fully autonomous Web3 elder care solution that blends AI, blockchain, and decentralized infrastructure into a seamless experience. 🚀
