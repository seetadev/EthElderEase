# Eth ElderEase
ElderEase is an AI-powered concierge that leverages Amazon Bedrock, AgentKit, Storacha, Js-libp2p and Nethermind (dotnet-libp2p), EigenLayer AVS to provide secure, decentralized home assistance and emergency monitoring for seniors.

üß© Tech Stack & Architecture

1Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Concierge & Automation (Amazon Bedrock + LLMs)
- Amazon Bedrock Agents power ElderEase‚Äôs concierge, handling service requests, scheduling, and real-time decision-making.
- Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Amazon Knowledge Bases to provide personalized responses based on elderly users' preferences, past interactions, and care needs.
- Custom fine-tuned LLMs run on Bedrock, trained on elder care best practices, home maintenance data, and emergency protocols.
- Dynamic AI workflows: Using Amazon Bedrock‚Äôs orchestration capabilities, we created "chain-of-thought" workflows, allowing AI agents to reason step-by-step before taking action.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Web3 Payments & Smart Contracts (AgentKit + Ethereum + Filecoin)
- AgentKit enables seamless, gas-efficient payments for services via FIL, ETH, or stablecoins.
- Smart contract escrow system ensures that payments are held until AI agents verify service completion.
- Uses EigenLayer AVS (Hyperlane, Gaia) for trustless verification of completed tasks before releasing payments.
- Voice-Activated Web3 Payments: We connected Alexa Skills to AgentKit, enabling seniors to pay service providers with "Alexa, confirm my home cleaning payment."

3Ô∏è‚É£ Peer to Peer Communication between AI agents using Storacha backend
  Secure & P2P AI Communication JS-libp2p and Nethermind‚Äôs dotnet libp2p
- AI agents communicate directly using libp2p‚Äôs P2P networking stack instead of relying on centralized APIs.
- Enables secure, low-latency service coordination between caregivers, cleaning staff, and maintenance teams.
- No Centralized API Calls: Using Nethermind‚Äôs dotnet libp2p, AI agents send service requests, confirm payments, and exchange status updates without ever touching centralized cloud APIs.

4Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Computer Vision & Emergency Alerts (FFmpeg + TinyYOLO + IPFS + Ethereum)
ElderEase‚Äôs home monitoring system uses cameras (ONVIF, RTSP, HTTP, iOS) with FFmpeg and TinyYOLO AI models to detect:
 -  Falls or accidents
 -  Intruders or unexpected movement
 -  Leaking pipes, fire hazards, or broken appliances

If a critical event is detected, AI agents generate an alert, which is:
- Saved on IPFS
- Hashed and stored on Ethereum using the iOS device UUID as the lookup key
- Broadcasted via EigenLayer AVS (Witness Chain) for decentralized verification

No Cloud Storage Needed: Instead of relying on AWS or Google Cloud for event logs, ElderEase stores alarms directly on IPFS, ensuring privacy and censorship resistance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ EigenLayer AVS for On-Chain Verification (Hyperlane + Gaia + Opacity)
ElderEase integrates EigenLayer AVSs for decentralized verification of services and alarms:
 -  Hyperlane: Verifies service execution across chains
 -  Gaia: Ensures AI-generated alerts are verifiable and tamper-proof
 -  Opacity: Provides on-chain privacy for AI transactions
Hacky Trick:
 üîπ EigenLayer AVS as AI Validators: We use Gaia AVS to verify object detection results‚Äîensuring that AI doesn‚Äôt falsely trigger alerts due to hallucinations.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Scalable AI Knowledge Base on AWS (S3 + Bedrock + EC2 Hosting)
AI concierge retrieves personalized recommendations from an S3-hosted knowledge base.
EC2 instances host AI-driven home cleaning services, scaling as demand grows.
Hacky Trick:
 üîπ Custom LLM Indexing: Instead of using a single vector DB, we precompute and cache embeddings for faster responses.

üöÄ Key Innovations & Why It‚Äôs Exciting
